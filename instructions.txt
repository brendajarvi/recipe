Ingredients:
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
3/4 cup granulated sugar
3/4 cup packed light brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 large eggs
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips

Instructions:
Preheat the Oven:

Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or lightly grease them.
Cream Butter and Sugars:

In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until smooth and creamy.
Add Vanilla and Eggs:

Mix in the vanilla extract. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition until the mixture is light and fluffy.
Combine Dry Ingredients:

In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.
Combine Wet and Dry Mixtures:

Gradually add the flour mixture to the butter mixture, mixing until just combined. Do not overmix.
Add Chocolate Chips:

Stir in the semisweet chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the cookie dough.
Form Cookie Dough Balls:

Drop tablespoon-sized balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.
Bake the Cookies:

Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden brown. The centers should still be slightly soft.
Cool and Enjoy:

Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely.
